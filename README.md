# Wine Quality Prediction

This project analyzes the **Wine Quality Dataset** using machine learning techniques to predict the quality of wines based on their physicochemical properties.  
The notebook covers preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
- Explore the dataset and perform **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**.  
- Preprocess data and handle feature scaling.  
- Train classification models to predict wine quality.  
- Compare different models and visualize performance.  

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries:  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data handling  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` – ML algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/wine-quality.git
cd wine-quality
```

### 2. Install dependencies
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment.  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, install dependencies manually:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 3. Run the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook wine-quality.ipynb
```

## 📊 Models Implemented
- **Logistic Regression** – baseline classification.  
- **Decision Tree Classifier** – interpretable model.  
- **Random Forest Classifier** – ensemble approach for higher accuracy.  
- Other algorithms may also be explored.  

---

## 📈 Results
- Evaluation metrics such as **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.  
- Confusion matrices for better understanding of model predictions.  
- Visualizations of feature importance and correlations.
